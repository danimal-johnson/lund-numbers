# Administrator phone numbers

A very simple phone number search page for people with disabilities in Lund, Sweden.

## Background
The Kommune maintains 12 phone numbers for assisting people with disabilities, distributed in a seemingly-random fashion. Those numbers are listed by date in a confusing semi-sorted lookup table. The purpose of this page is to make that lookup easier.

## Use

Enter your birth date and month. The number to call will appear.
